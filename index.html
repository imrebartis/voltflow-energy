        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>VoltFlow Energy develops next-generation energy storage systems that make solar power reliable and accessible for European SMEs. Our mission is to accelerate the continent's transition to renewable energy by solving the critical challenge of energy intermittency. We combine advanced lithium-silicon battery technology with AI-powered energy management software that predicts consumption patterns and optimizes storage utilization. Our systems reduce dependency on grid electricity by up to 78%, cutting energy costs while advancing climate goals. We're committed to making clean energy economically viable for mid-sized businesses across manufacturing, logistics, and commercial real estate sectors.</p>

    <section id="target-market">
        <h2>Target Market</h2>
        <p>We serve energy-intensive SMEs across the European Union with annual electricity costs exceeding €50,000. Our primary customers include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturing facilities (25-200 employees) with high daytime energy consumption</li>
            <li>Cold storage and logistics companies requiring 24/7 refrigeration</li>
            <li>Commercial real estate portfolios (office parks, shopping centers)</li>
            <li>Data centers seeking backup power and cost optimization</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our geographic focus spans Germany, Netherlands, France, and Spain—markets with strong solar adoption but limited storage solutions. We specifically target businesses with existing solar arrays between 100-500kW who are losing potential savings due to lack of storage capacity.</p>

        <h2>Our Value Proposition</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Unlike traditional battery vendors who sell commodity hardware</strong>, VoltFlow Energy delivers an intelligent energy ecosystem. Our differentiation rests on three pillars:</p>
            <p><strong>Technical Superiority:</strong> Proprietary silicon-enhanced lithium cells achieve 2,850 charge cycles at 80% capacity retention—industry average is 1,500 cycles. This translates to 9 additional years of service life, reducing total cost of ownership by €47,000 over system lifetime.</p>
            <p><strong>Predictive Intelligence:</strong> FlowAI's neural network processes weather forecasts, production schedules, and historical patterns to optimize when to store, discharge, or sell excess energy back to the grid. Customers typically see 23% better ROI compared to passive storage systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Seamless Integration:</strong> Our universal inverter works with 40+ solar panel manufacturers and integrates with building management systems via REST API. No equipment replacement needed—we augment existing investments rather than replacing them.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, we offer a performance guarantee: if energy savings don't reach 60% of projections within the first year, we refund the difference. No competitor in the €100K-€500K price segment provides this level of accountability.</p>
